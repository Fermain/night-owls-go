## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Icons Required**: The PWA won't work properly until icons are generated
2. **HTTPS Required**: PWAs require HTTPS in production (you already have this)
3. **Testing**: Test on actual mobile devices, not just desktop
4. **Updates**: Service worker handles automatic updates

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### **If PWA installation doesn't work**:
1. Check browser dev tools → Application → Manifest
2. Verify all icon files exist
3. Ensure HTTPS is working
4. Clear browser cache and try again

### **If icons appear broken**:
1. Re-run the icon generation script
2. Check that `app/static/icons/` directory exists
3. Verify file permissions

### **Service worker issues**:
1. Check browser dev tools → Application → Service Workers
2. Unregister and refresh if needed
3. Check for console errors

## 🎉 Success Criteria

Your PWA is complete when:
- ✅ Icons are generated and visible
- ✅ Install prompt appears on mobile
- ✅ App works offline (basic functionality)
- ✅ App shortcuts work correctly
- ✅ Logo appears correctly in all components
