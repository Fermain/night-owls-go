# Night Owls Control - Security Audit Report

## Summary

I've conducted a security audit of the repository and found the following items that need attention:

## ‚úÖ Good Security Practices Found

1. **Environment Variables**: Sensitive configuration is properly handled through environment variables
2. **No Production Secrets**: No production secrets were found hardcoded in the codebase
3. **JWT Implementation**: Proper JWT token generation and validation
4. **Test Files**: Test secrets are appropriately used only in test files

## üö® Binary Files in Git History

The following binary files were found tracked in git and have been removed:
- `api.test` (23.5 MB)
- `cmd/server/server`
- `main`
- `night-owls-server`
- `outbox.test` (10 MB)
- `server`
- `service.test` (11.7 MB)

**Action Taken**: These files have been removed from git tracking with `git rm --cached`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Development Secrets (Low Risk)

1. **Makefile**: Contains a hardcoded JWT secret for development:
   ```makefile
   JWT_SECRET=dev-jwt-secret
   ```
   **Risk**: Low - This is clearly for development only
   **Recommendation**: Consider using an environment variable even for dev

2. **Test Files**: Test secrets in `internal/api/auth_middleware_test.go`:
   - `test-secret-key-for-valid-token`
   - `test-secret-context`
   - etc.
   **Risk**: None - These are appropriate for tests

## üìÅ Updated .gitignore

The `.gitignore` file has been comprehensively updated to exclude:
- All Go binary outputs (`*.test`, `*.exe`, `main`, `server`)
- Database files (`*.db`, `*.sqlite`)
- Log files (`*.log`)
- Environment files (`.env*` except `env.example`)
- Certificates and keys (`*.pem`, `*.key`, `*.crt`)
- Build artifacts and temporary files
- IDE and OS-specific files

## üîí Security Recommendations

1. **Remove Binary Files from Git History**:
   ```bash
   # WARNING: This rewrites history - coordinate with team
   git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
     'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch *.test server main night-owls-server' \
     --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
   ```
   Or use BFG Repo-Cleaner for easier cleanup.

2. **Environment Configuration**:
   - ‚úÖ `env.example` properly shows placeholders
   - ‚úÖ No `.env` files are tracked
   - ‚úÖ Production configuration handled separately

3. **GitHub Repository Settings**:
   - Enable secret scanning
   - Enable push protection for secrets
   - Add branch protection rules for main

4. **Development Workflow**:
   - Consider using direnv or similar for automatic env loading
   - Document that developers should never commit `.env` files

## ‚úÖ No Critical Security Issues Found

- No hardcoded production secrets
- No API keys or tokens in code
- No database credentials exposed
- Proper use of environment variables
- JWT secrets properly externalized

## üìã Checklist for Production

- [ ] Ensure strong JWT secret (32+ characters)
- [ ] Rotate all development secrets
- [ ] Enable HTTPS only
- [ ] Configure CORS properly
- [ ] Set up rate limiting
- [ ] Enable security headers
- [ ] Review and remove debug endpoints
- [ ] Ensure database file permissions (600)

## Conclusion

The codebase follows good security practices. The main issue was binary files being tracked in git, which has been addressed. No production secrets or sensitive data were found hardcoded in the repository.
